<h1>Hi, I’m Anna. </h1>
<p>
 For more than a decade, I’ve partnered with organizations to strengthen product quality, reduce operational and legal risk, and embed accessibility directly into their digital infrastructure. I build scalable systems and frameworks that enable teams to ship higher-quality products with greater clarity, less rework, and far less chaos.
