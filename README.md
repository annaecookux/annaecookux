<h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Anna. </h1>
<p>
 I am a Senior Inclusive Designer that specializes in building inclusive products. With over ten years of experience, I am dedicated to creating scalable systems to support accessible and inclusive practices across digital product teams. Currently, I am a Senior Designer at Microsoft focusing on accessibility and inclusion for Azure and an M.S. student in Creative Technology & Design at the ATLAS Institute of CU-Boulder.
</p>
<p>I am currently taking time to dig deeper into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as learn Unity and C++ in my graduate studies. I'm excited to work on my interdisciplinary skills.<p>
  <p> If you're looking at my work here, please be kind. ðŸ’–</p>
